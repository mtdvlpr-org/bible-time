# Support

If you need help using BibleTime or running the project locally, there are a few ways to get assistance:

1. **Contact Form**
   - Use the contact form in the app (available at `/contact` or `/en/contact`) for general inquiries or feedback.

2. **GitHub Issues**
   - Open an issue for bugs or feature requests: provide a clear title, description, and steps to reproduce.
   - Include helpful context: browser/OS, Node and pnpm versions, and any server logs or console output.

3. **GitHub Discussions**
   - For general questions, design ideas, or help getting started, use Discussions (if enabled) to have community conversations.

What to include in a bug report

- Description: what happened?
- Steps to reproduce: exact steps to reproduce the issue.
- Expected vs actual: what did you expect and what happened instead?
- Environment: OS, browser, Node.js version, pnpm version, and any environment variables or Supabase configuration used.
- Screenshots / logs: include screenshots or relevant logs if available.
